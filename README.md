# swapi-selenium
This project was created based on the open API website https://swapi.dev/
This project is an example of data driven test using selenium (java+testng)
Test cases were designed for different endpoints (people/planet/vehicle/specie/starship), the format is .csv.
The test case file can be amended - no script change is required if add a new row but if add an extra column, we need to make a few updates in script.
